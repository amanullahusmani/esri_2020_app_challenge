## Mission Statement

Smart City is an emerging concept that describes a highly-digitalized urban area. Using technics of electronic Internet of Things (IoT), the City’s data, resources and service can be efficiently collected, stored, managed, accessed and analyzed. The city data digitalization can be very beneficial for its citizens, especially in Healthcare. The healthcare needs of the citizen are very high in volume. But managing this onrush of literally millions of patients has forced the industry to confront significant challenges. And the most fundamental challenge is how to provide the right care at the right place at the right time at an affordable price (to individuals and society). A system containing digitalized Healthcare resources helps the healthcare providers to promote their services as well as helping the patients to find the needed health care. Healthcare resources digital transformation builds this bridge between the healthcare providers and payers. 

Living in the age of digitalization, every aspect of care delivery and operations has been changed from the past. This generation of patients is not willing to spend time on traditional processes of searching. Instead, they want immediate access to the right healthcare service, professional doctors and results. They do not want to waste time going to the wrong services. They want price transparency and supporting data to help make healthcare decisions. So, it’s important to have a system enabling smarter choices and better utilization of time and resources. 

This application is expected to step ahead closer to the digital smart city. The team members organize the data from many various resources and generate a healthcare database for the Toronto citizens. Taking advantage of Esri’s smart mapping GIS Online system, this application’s goal is to provide a healthcare querying platform, improving Toronto citizens’ experience of looking for health care that in need. Using our app, the patients will have clear information that which hospital/clinic should they go to, what’s the healthcare capacity and how long they will expect to wait before seeing a doctor.
